# GOLF GUFF

**Codename:** The Ring  
**Mission:** a memory-light, recursive, reality-aware AI development console for solo developers.

GOLF GUFF is not a single GGUF. It is the routing, benchmarking, reality-model, verification, capability-bus and governed-execution layer that decides which local model or deterministic tool may act on which layer of a developer's reality.

## L0 — Ring Foundation

- `RealityStack` — explicit physical, OS, runtime, project, application, simulation, semantic, memory, meta and representation coordinates.
- `Caddy` — routes work toward tiny/core/deep local inference, deterministic tools or human review.
- `Recursor` — bounded recursive refinement with hard depth/step/confidence stops.

## L1 — Pristine Model Identity

- cryptographic model manifests, provenance, licensing and hardware contracts.
- immutable `guff:model:sha256:<digest>` identities and streaming SHA-256 verification.

## L2 — SCORECARD Foundation

- immutable hardware identity plus task-specific quality, latency, memory, reliability and optional energy telemetry.

## L3 — CADDY × SCORECARD Fusion

- measured, verified, hardware-compatible club selection with explicit refusal states.

## L4 — Persistent SCORECARD + Route Trace

- append-only cold benchmark journal, bounded strongest-N hydration and explainable route traces.

## L5 — DATA LEECH + Context Slices

- permissioned file/repo/tool-output observation, SHA-256 deltas and disposable bounded context arenas.

## L6 — SYMBIOSIS LEDGER

- grant lifecycle, revocation/expiry, bounded observation stamps and explicit reversible ORGANIC-facing memory promotion.

## L7 — ZENKAI Verification Loop

- bounded attempt → evidence → verification → retry/stop orchestration.
- retries after attempt zero require explicit bounded retry authority.

## L8 — DOJO Trace Store

- content-addressed compact learning episodes from CADDY + ZENKAI outcomes.
- raw candidate state and route traces are represented by hashes, not retained bodies.

## L9 — CLUBHOUSE Slot Capability Bus

- content-addressed `SlotManifest` cartridges with typed capabilities, STRATA layers, permission requirements and payload ceilings.
- `READY` means a slot invocation is eligible for execution, not that execution occurred.

## L10 — FORGE Execution Adapter

- re-verifies transient payload bytes + SHA-256 against the CLUBHOUSE invocation.
- enforces wall-time/output contracts and turns executor outcomes into typed ZENKAI evidence.
- retains hashes/counters rather than raw tool transcripts.

## L11 — Native Local-Process Executor

The Ring can now spawn its first governed OS process without introducing a shell surface:

- `NativeProcessRegistry` binds an exact immutable `LOCAL_PROCESS` slot to an absolute executable path and fixed argv contract.
- the request payload cannot select an executable or command string.
- payload mode is either `NONE` or `SINGLE_ARGUMENT`; a payload is never split into shell tokens.
- POSIX uses direct `fork` + `execve`; Windows uses direct `CreateProcessW` with explicit application path and argv quoting.
- working directories are canonicalized and must stay beneath a registered working root.
- environment entries are explicit, validated and bounded by count/bytes.
- stdout and stderr stream into the existing bounded `ForgeOutputSink`.
- the child is terminated when the FORGE output or wall-time ceiling is crossed.
- exit status flows back through `ForgeExecutorReport`, so FORGE still owns `BUILD` / `TEST` / `TOOL` evidence semantics.

## Design laws

1. **Reality has layers.** Context must declare what layer it belongs to.
2. **Memory is a cache, not the world.** Rehydrate permitted source data on demand.
3. **Recursion is bounded.** Every loop has depth, step and confidence stop conditions.
4. **Tools beat guessing.** Deterministic operations route to deterministic tools when possible.
5. **Symbiosis is permissioned.** User authority is the root authority.
6. **Aesthetics never corrupt semantics.** CHROMA/AURA/GLYPH remain presentation metadata.
7. **Model identity is cryptographic.** A filename never establishes trust.
8. **Benchmarks are contextual.** A score without task + hardware identity is not routing evidence.
9. **Routing requires evidence.** No benchmark, no invented club selection.
10. **Persistence stays cold by default.** Disk is the corpus; RAM holds only the current working slice.
11. **Every route is explainable.** Selection and refusal gates leave a bounded trace.
12. **Perception requires a grant.** DATA LEECH cannot create its own authority or escape its granted source boundary.
13. **Hot context is disposable.** Source bodies remain external; task-local slices have hard byte/count budgets.
14. **Observation is not memory.** Seeing a source never silently promotes it into ORGANIC.
15. **Authority has lifecycle.** Grants can be pending, revoked or expired and are checked at action time.
16. **Promotion is explicit and reversible.** Only permitted, stamped facts may be promoted, and promoted summaries can be forgotten.
17. **Retries require authority.** A failed attempt does not automatically grant another execution attempt.
18. **Verification requires evidence.** Success is not accepted solely because a model says it succeeded.
19. **Self-correction is budgeted.** Attempts, tools, evidence and traces all have hard ceilings.
20. **Learning traces are summaries, not surveillance.** DOJO stores compact outcomes and hashes, not raw working context.
21. **Training evidence is content-addressed.** Episode identity changes when its meaningful compact record changes.
22. **Replay is bounded.** Learning history remains cold until a specific query hydrates a finite slice.
23. **Programs are cartridges, not fused organs.** CLUBHOUSE defines a common capability contract while domain executors stay separate.
24. **A slot cannot mint authority.** Permission requirements must be satisfied by authority supplied from outside the slot bus.
25. **Eligibility is not execution.** A `READY` invocation has passed the bus contract only; executor evidence is still required.
26. **FORGE re-verifies input identity.** A transient payload cannot be executed if it differs from the invocation hash/byte contract.
27. **Execution output is bounded and disposable.** FORGE keeps compact hashes/counters/evidence rather than raw tool transcripts.
28. **Execution evidence follows execution.** Refused invocations never masquerade as tool runs.
29. **Native execution is registry-bound.** The request cannot choose an arbitrary executable.
30. **Shell syntax is data.** Native payloads are never interpolated through a shell.
31. **Process reality is scoped.** Working directories must remain inside the registered root and environment state is bounded.
32. **Budgets terminate work.** Native children are stopped when time/output authority is exhausted.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

## Next

L12 should add the first execution-session orchestrator: one bounded transaction linking CADDY → CLUBHOUSE → FORGE → native executor → ZENKAI → DOJO with a common correlation identity and explicit artifact/evidence promotion rules.
